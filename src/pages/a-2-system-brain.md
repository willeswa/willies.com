<strong>Thinking, Fast and Slow</strong> is a book by the 2002 Nobel Prize winner <strong> <em>Daniel Kahneman</em> </strong> in which he explains in detail the human process of judgement and choice. While Kahneman talks about a wide range of ideas throught the book, my two favorites are <em>the two-sytem brain </em> and <em>WYSIATI</em>. In this post, I will explain my understaing of the former through the perspective of a <em>client-server model</em>.

##### The brain as a client-server model

When we are awake, our brain has a client and a server in its "brainy" network. The client is constanly sending requests to the server whenever necessary. Now, when a particular request is sent over to the server enough times, the client will cache it for optimization purposes. Consequently, future similar requests will take less time and effort and will become automatic because the are cached.

If a new request is made that the client hasn't cached yet, the client will have to involve the server to query the requested data from the "bigger memory".  

##### A practical example

Consider the following two questions: 1 + 1 = ? Or "The capital of France is ...?". To most people, the answers to these questions come automatically as if they were born knowing them. This is because the answers to such questions have been cached in the client of the brain.

Now, consider this question: 17 x 25 = ? Again, most people will not know the answer to the above question with the ease of the previous two questions. This, to the brain, was a new idea. The server must be involved to get the appropriate answer.

##### The answer-sourcing process

To achieve this, the brain will search for an appropriate algorithim for getting the answer. If an algorithm is not available, the brain will use its knowledge from existing algorithms to model a solution. This is called creativity or innovation. It thus follows that the more you know the more problems you solve, the more you are likely to be creative or innovative. 

##### Learning from this

As a junior engineer, it is easy to get frastred when things are not working out. It is much harder to model solutions or even know the appropriate tech stack to choose for a project. It doesn't mean you are less smart.  Senior engineers have been exposed to most of these problems many times. They have cached some of the solutions and can use their knowledge to model new solutions. This is why senior egineers are better at problem solving compared to junior engineers. Our path as junior engineers is the same, solve more problems do more projects.
