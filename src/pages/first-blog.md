I recently got laid off from Andela a few weeks to being a junior developer (I will share my experience in a separate post). Among all the tasks that were part of the training, I found writing to be the most mundane. But it is such tasks that are, ironically, most important. I am trying to draw the lessons from the training to be part of my professional life.

##### Documenting Tool

During the training, part of the weekly deliverable was to write a reflection that includes the achievements, failures, and the action plan. This leads to a culture of documenting your ideas and thoughts which eventually can help you to be more aware of your actions and choices. Being aware of your own choices gets you in control of your most valuable resource; time.

##### Open Sourcing Knowledge

One of my colleagues at Andela was a strong proponent of open source. Amongst his philosophies, is "let your work speak for you". An idea he says he borrowed from <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13525945-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you> this book </a>. One way we can do this is by sharing our knowledge and perspectives. Because the internet has replaced the public square space, blogs provide a great platform for that.

##### Better Communication

A common belief in the tech circles is that you only learn by doing. That is why every documentation has some sort of a mini-tutorial where you build using the technology in question. Writing is pretty much the same. I have cringed reading my previous journal mini-writings. I hope by documenting these, I will improve as I go along. I will be able to increase my vocabulary and communicate better my thoughts.
