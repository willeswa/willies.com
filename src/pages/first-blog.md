I recently got laid off from Andela a few weeks to being a junior developer (I will share my experience in a separate post). Among all the tasks that were part of the training, I found writing to be the most mundane. But it is such tasks that are, ironically, most important. I am trying draw the lessons from the training to be part of my professional life.

##### Documenting Tool

During the traning, part of the weekly deliverable was to write a reflection that include the achievements, the failures and the action plan. This leads to a culture of documenting your ideas and thoughts which eventually can help you to be more aware of your actions and choices. Being aware of your own choices gets you in control of your most valuable resource; time.

##### Open Sourcing Knowledge

One of my collegues at Andela was a strong proponent of open source. Amongst his philosphies, is "let your work speak for you". An idea he says he borrowed from <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13525945-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you> this book </a>. One way we can do this is by sharing our knowledge and perspectives. Because the internet has replaced the public squre space, blogs provide a great plartform for that.
